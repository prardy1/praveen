

Thank you all for joining the call, as discussed I have setup this call for 1 hour everyday till end of this month, however feel free to suggest and let we know if this time/duration/period of the call do not suit you.

During further observations identified those 4 suggestions/enhancements/issues and raised a JIRA ticket, let me know if there are any clarifications needed.



Just to add to the previous questions, I guess you would have already answered, I feel the videos are good. and if you can increase/elaborate content related to introduction of the product and where this will fit in the VISA eco system, and is it a new/backfill initiative and what are the inscope/out of scope of this product to start with and also with few more examples it may be more informative.
